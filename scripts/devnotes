USABLE MACHINES:

First Tier:
Lathe
Rolling Machine
Cutting Machine

Second Tier:
Oil?
Reinforced Blast Furnace
Planer (MGC Crusher)
Grinder
Sifter
-Metal Press

iron dust is gained through the crusher
coal flux through the sifter
iron dust + coke -> steel dust
grinder is used for something misc? probably for the blast furnace and some weaponry
steel dust which is smelted in the blast furnace

//probably rename these three

Arc Furnace
Crusher
Precision Assembler
-Electrolyser
-Chemical Reactor
-Crystallizer
